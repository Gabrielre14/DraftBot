The reduced visibility forces you to move cautiously between century-old trees with blackened trunks. Suddenly, a deaf crack breaks the disturbing silence. The branches bend and break under immense weight. Through the ash sail, a massive silhouette emerges: a colossal troll, its rugged volcanic soot skin. Its glowing eyes broke the dusty darkened while it grows a roar that shakes the trees around. This primitive drill keeper does not clearly understand your intrusion into his domain...",
      "slimyMutant": "The more you progress in the Numerous Forest, the more oppressive the atmosphere. Volcanic ashes seem to absorb all sounds, creating almost supernatural silence. Then you notice something strange — your own shadow seems to be moving independently of your movements. You turn abruptly and discover with horror a gelatin and verdatre mass that slowly inverts to you. But the most disturbing thing is that it begins to take your appearance, copying your traits, your veins, even your weapons. The Vaseux Mutant watches you with your own eyes, a malicious smile deforming what should be your face. This perfect mimetisme makes the fight come all the more destabilizing ..."

You advance cautiously between the houses that have been built, scrutinizing every corner in the hope of finding a sign of life. Suddenly, in the turn of a lane, you freeze, and a dry crack rings on the ground. In front of you stands a skeleton with an empty eye, armed to the teeth, seemingly ready to listen..."

The more you move on, the more tiny slabs massage around your feet. The horror cries of these small creatures are forced to shine in the cave. You feel the ground vibrated, something big is approaching at high speed, it is nothing more than an abominal spiked of huge size, Seeing the corpses of her children to your feet, she shouts with rage and runs over you."

It seems slow but knowing that you should never underestimate your opponent you gain your weapon ready to face this new threat..."

The touching air, loaded with magmatic lifts, makes you spin the skin. With every inspiration, the nausee wins. Your wounded wakes up, each step is heavier than the previous one, but you are running off than cut. As you think you touch the tip of your troubles, the ground trembles. The magma freezes, the lava flows and together they take shape. An entity. A colossus stands before you. Blood, foggy like this volcano, pulses into you. You prepare for the ultimate battle."

Your limbs are gradually numbing despite your efforts to maintain your bloodstream. Suddenly, you notice a dark shape that moves silently through the snow curtain. You freeze, all your senses on alert. A deafened rumble pierces the howl of the wind. Then emerges from the storm two eyes of an icy blue, shining with a wild intelligence. A majestic and imposing white wolf stands in front of you. Its immaculate fur blends perfectly with its environment, and its fangs glow in the darkness. This Arctic predator judges you, evaluating whether you have a prey or a threat. His sharp gaze seems to read in your eye while he prepares to bounce..."

You can see from the beautiful gems coming out of the walls that the place bears its name. Your steps sound against the surrounding walls, their sound back to you just like your image that reflects against the thousands of precious stones. You play with the echo while admiring the place, but all of a sudden, a sound that doesn't seem to come from you until your tympans. Crystals seem to be typing each other, stronger and stronger. Suddenly, a cluster of these stones takes on a humanoi<unk> form twice as large as you. The light that crosses this entity decomposes into a beautiful rainbow, but in view of the aggression that the creation has towards you, you feel it will be necessary to stop this beautiful illumination."

Takes several seconds to get used to brightness, you can see hundreds of steps that have two gigantic doors surrounded by two equally large statues. You do not intend to stop in such a good way, so you start climbing hard one after the other. You are careful not to fall on the stones made slippery by the ice that formed on it. After several minutes of intense walking, you arrive at the feet of the building. The entries on the doors are not familiar: indeed, they are written in a writing that is unknown to you. In any case, the doors are on your way, and you need to cross them to move forward. So you try to place your palm on the cold stone, and suddenly a mechanism becomes active and the doors begin to grind. After several seconds, the doors are finally completely open, but the mechanism does not stop making noise. Then when you turn on your right, you notice that the statue begins to move and catch a hammer that is on its scale..."

Your steps crack on the hard snow by strong winds that threaten to cause you to lose balance at every moment. As you thought you had reached the top, the ground trembles beneath your feet. A titanic roar shakes the icy air, so powerful that it provokes an avalanche in the distance. Looking up towards the low clouds, you see a gigantic shadow hovering over you. Suddenly, it plunges into the earth in a deafening crack. A colossal ice dragon landed in front of you, its crystalline scales glittering like a thousand diamonds. Its breath instantly turns the air into icy fog while its blue arctic eyes fix you with a thousand intelligence. This high lord decided that your intrusion into his domain would meditate a definitive answer..."

The ambient temperature should normally turn this lake into a solid ice block. You kneel down to examine the dark water, trying to pierce the secret of its abysmal depth. It was then that a bunch of bubbles slowly risen to the surface, disturbing the perfect mirror of the lake. You recover instinctively when sudden, the water starts boiling violently. A monstrous maw erupts from the depths, armed with prehistoric fangs. A giant crocodile, adapted to the extreme cold by thousands of years of evolution, emerges from its aquatic lair. Its thick and scaling skin bears the marks of countless fights. Its yellow eyes, cold like the ice that surrounds it, look at you with the relentless patience of a perfect predator. He watched in these mysterical waters devouring everything that dared to reach his territory..."

Each step echoes in this desolation, as if the stones themselves kept the memory of the tragedies passed. You are cautiously exploring the rubble, trying to imagine the nature that once reigned there. Suddenly, a crystalline melody floats in the icy air, so beautiful that it attracts you irresistibly to its source. Surrounded by a stunned house, you can see a striking silhouette. A woman in immaculate white kimono seems to slip on the snow without leaving any traces. Its long black hair floats in an invisible breeze, while its albarestre skin radiates with spectral glow. But when she turns her face towards you, you realize with horror that her eyes are two icy neant wells. The Yuki-Onna, the vengeful spirit of the snowy mountains, reveals you a smile that promises a death as beautiful as it is terrible."

The closer you get into the icy count, the greater the size of the creature hidden behind this barrier. Suddenly, cracks appear in the ice, spreading like sour canvas. A deafened rumble makes the rock walls vibrate. The wall explodes in an apocalyptic fracture, throwing massive ice blocks. Through this broken crystal curtain emerges the most majestic of creatures: an ice dragon of pharaotic dimensions. Its presence seems imposing and its wings repaired almost to the stone will. It has a terrifying beauty, with its iriseed scales capturing the weak light in icy rainbows. Her eyes, deep blue like the abysses, shine with ancient wisdom and maternal fury. Behind it you see a gigantic egg with pearl reflections, pulling with mystery. You have just peeled in his nursery, and no intrusion will go unpunished in the Ice Queen's Sanctuary..."
