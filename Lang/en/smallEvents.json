But be careful: it does not work on the magic or actions of the gods, or if the opponent did not attack, that goes without saying. I have always said that observation was the key to the battle.",
      "{emote:fightActions.cursedAttack} Cursed Attack, a technique I've seen used by partisan opponents a spell born of the accumulation of all the grudge of this world. It curses the opponent so that he may suffer the consequences in the future. Remarkably, it will heal you if the opponent still has a lot of energy at the time of attack is used.",
      "{emote:fightActions.darkAttack} The dark, fearsome and unpredictable attack! This spell was born of the build-up of the darkest forces in the world, and only a fighter who plunged his eyes into the ability of magic can hope to use it. It uses the power of the opponent to reinforce itself while ignoring its defence. It can give you some of your lost breath or blind. Blind sometimes makes the opponent unable to attack, while reducing his defense and speed.",

Only fighters who have experienced their patience and experience the gods will be able to taste the full flavor of their magical power. Its precision increases with the hardness of the fight. It is part of the group of \"actions of the gods\" and fails if two divine actions have already been carried out in combat.",
      "{emote:fightActions.energeticAttack} Energy Attack, here's a combat technique that I learned particurely! It heals the attacker half of the degae inflicted, and ignores even part of the defence. This is what I call a maneuver that feeds the fighter, but be careful: its accuracy decreases with uses, and I observed that his healing power was exhausted after three uses and that it is less effective against monsters.",
      "{emote:fightActions.eruptionAttack} The eruption, a remote demonstration of impressive elementary power! It erupts the volcano that spits molten rocks. According to my expedition, only the fastest will be able to avoid the problems of this controlled disaster.",
      "{emote:fightActions.familyMealAttack} The family meal, a physical... original technique! She calls for allies to hang on the opponent and poison him. The launcher then becomes reputed, replacing a potential alteration of the state of which he would be victims. I've seen a lot of strange things in combat, but this one is still morable!",
      "{emote:fightActions.fireAttack} fire-attack is one of the most formidable skills I had ever experienced. This pure infernal concentric of power and heat pours on the opponent, the calcinant then on one or more additional towers due to the \"brute\" alteration. Meet the fighters who cast this spel! If you cast it, use this attack if you froze to heat!",

It requires physical contact and forcefully crashes to your opponent's defence, breaking it under its powerful blows and tearing off the opponent a quarter of its protection. However, I could notice that she was constantly failing when the attacker had more defenses than her opponent.",
      "{emote:fightActions.intenseAttack} The intense, exhausting, physical but potentially devastating! It never fails on a faster opponent and works better on a fast opponent. Be careful, however: it forces the launcher to rest in the next turn and cannot kill the opponent. I was also able to notice that it was much less effective in the face of a high defence.",
      "{emote:fightActions.heatDrainAttack} heat drain, a technique I've seen from some monstrous opponents! It recovers the player's heat, increasing the caster's attack and freezing the opponent. Fascinating to see how the weather can become a weapon. If you frost, you will be slowed down and you will be hurt.",

      "{emote:fightActions.magicMimicAttack} Magical Mimic Attack, brilliant demonstration of adaptation! It can retaliate after an attack from the opponent. The response will be much better if the opponent has just used a magic attack. The art of using the enemy's strength against itself.",

      "{emote:fightActions.mudShotAttack} Mud Shot, a simple but effective ranged attack! It deals tricks and makes the opponent dirty. This is a technique I have often seen used by swamp monsters. Dirty can be an asset in a battle, because it increases elevation and protects you from other state alterations but it also makes it more vulnerable to some attacks.",
      "{emote:fightActions.outrageAttack} The coley, powerful but risky emotional technique! It would have failed if you use it while you have a state alteration.

I saw a lot of fights lost because of an ill-conceived core.",
      "{emote:fightActions.petrificationAttack} Petrification is a fearsome long-range control technique, because it adjusts the target for two turns while doubling its spell. An opponent locked but reinforced - you have to make the most of it.",
      "{emote:fightActions.piercingAttack} The pierced attack, the spec of the fine strategy! This melee coprs technique almost completely ignores the opponent's defence. The attacker has a probability of levelling his opponent's defence. Each hit counts in this ability.",
      "{emote:fightActions.poisonousAttack} The poisoned attack was developed by the kingdom's most gifted alchemists. I was able to learn from the court archives that his poison was derived from the venom of many animals. but its exact composition remains a mystical one. After a direct confrontation with the opponent, it poisons the opponent with an alteration that lasts at least three turns and inflicts some grief on the hardness. I also noticed that this attack is much more effective in the early stage!",
      "{emote:fightActions.powerfulAttack} The mighty attack, risky, but potentially devastating! This physical attack reduces the speed of the opponent and can do more tricks at the cost of a stun of the attacker. Warning: After three uses, attack degae is reduced, so you have to learn how to use it at the right time to optimize its effectiveness.",
      "{emote:fightActions.protection} The protection, defensive technique I taught to all my infants! It would have failed if you use it while you have a state alteration. The \"protected\" alteration lasts for three rounds and takes you to fall victim to another alteration while offering a defensive boost.",
      "{emote:fightActions.quickAttack} Quick Attack, perfect against slow opponents! I have often had to deal with vicious murderers who wanted my life and I had to deal with this body technique. She never failed on a slower opponent and the slower the opponent, the slower the attack. Speed has always been a major asset in combat.",
      "{emote:fightActions.rageExplosion} The explosion of rage, a brutal release of pent-up anger! It lets the rage built up within you explode during the journey, projecting it directly onto the enemy. I have seen warriors transform their frustration into a formidable weapon.",

If the attacker is not stamped by the attack, it recovers a portion of the damage inflicted. The attack can also stun the opponent. You have to accept suffering in order to cause suffering.",

      "{emote:fightActions.sabotageAttack} sabotage attack, a sneak but effective body technique! It completely ignores the opponent's defenses and works better on an opponent with little attack. Less than a breath of breath but can paralyse the launcher - if so, degae is increased.",
      "{emote:fightActions.shieldAttack} The shield attack, a physical technique I perfected during my service years! She uses the attacker's defense to fight, weakening the opponent and dividing his attack by three for two rounds. The best defense is the attack!",

      "{emote:fightActions.slamAttack} The attack impacts, an effective slowing technique! It is a ranged attack of low power that reduces the opponent's speed. Slowing down your enemy can often be more prized than inflicting big tears.",

      "{emote:fightActions.tailWhipAttack} The tail strike, a primitive but effective attack! This powerful tail hits the opponent with a melee body, inflicting average degae with a chance to stunt. I have learned to challenge any creature with such an appendix because I can assure you that a blow of this magnitude in the middle of the stomach after one of the king's feasts is far from agreeable!",
      "{emote:fightActions.ultimateAttack} was the ultimate attack, the most powerful physical technique a fighter could possess! It requires a repair spin and can only be used once per battle. When you deploy it, make sure it is at the right time because it will only succeed if you are at the end of your strength and you no longer have much energy.",
